Hi,

I would like to show you a piece of my work.

This is a landing page of an interior design agency. I used HTML/CSS, SCSS, JQuery slick-slider and CSS carousels. Also, the layout is adaptive with a burger menu and media queries.

Please, have a look at https://maria-khudolii.github.io/Locus_landing/ Thank you for your interest and time!

All the best wishes, Maria
